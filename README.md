## **A Game Change Obsidian Plugin**

The Power of Influx:

Daily notes and backlinks are compelling, and the more I use Obsidian, the better it becomes.

The only "but" using Obsidian is how it returns the information from the backlink. I always heard it is due to a natural limitation: Obsidian focuses on a page, and Roam Research on a block.

Then Logseq appears and, accessing the same Obsidian database, returns information like Roam Research.

I couldn't believe it when I, by chance, found **Influx**, a game-change plug-in for Obsidian.

The picture below shows how Obsidian returns information from a Daily Note backlink.

and this is the **Power of Influx plug-in**:

The way Obsidian returns the backlinks information is almost useless for my usage, but **Influx** has changed everything.

*This limitation of Obsidian, for sure, **demotivates users to migrate** from Roam, Logseq, and other programs to Obsidian because those programs work based on Daily Notes with blocks, bullets, and sub-bullets.*
